## 📂 Selected Case Studies

### 1. Cloud PC Deployment for High-Compliance Healthcare
**Role:** Lead Architect & Engineer | **Scale:** 500+ Users

*   **Problem**: Client required a secure, compliant remote work environment for distinct user groups (Clinical Providers vs. Engineering) with strict data segmentation requirements.
*   **Action**:
    *   Designed and deployed **Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD)** and **Windows 365** Cloud PCs.
    *   Architected segmented **Azure VNets** to isolate clinical data from engineering workloads.
    *   Implemented role-based custom image configurations to optimize performance for heavy workloads.
*   **Outcome**: Successfully onboarded **500+ users** with zero downtime, enforcing HIPAA compliance through network isolation and granular access controls.
*   **Tools**: Azure Virtual Desktop, Windows 365, Azure Networking, PowerShell.

### 2. SIEM & XDR Modernization (HIPAA/SOC 2)
**Role:** Security Engineer | **Scale:** 2,000+ Endpoints

*   **Problem**: Legacy security tools were generating high false-positives and lacked unified visibility across a regulated 2,000-node fleet.
*   **Action**:
    *   Led the migration to **Microsoft Sentinel** and **Defender for Endpoint**.
    *   Configured data connectors for Azure AD, Firewall logs, and third-party feeds (Qualys/Tenable).
    *   Authored custom **KQL hunting queries** and analytics rules to detect specific healthcare-targeted threats.
    *   Orchestrated Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules and automated investigation workflows.
*   **Outcome**: Achieved full **HIPAA & SOC 2 audit readiness**. Reduced alert fatigue by tuning detection logic and centralized incident response in a single pane of glass.
*   **Tools**: Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, KQL, Azure Logic Apps.

### 3. Identity Governance & Escalation Management
**Role:** Senior Cloud Technician | **Context:** Managed Services (MSP)

*   **Problem**: High volume of identity-related security tickets and drift in privileged access accounts.
*   **Action**:
    *   Implemented **Privileged Identity Management (PIM)** and just-in-time access measures.
    *   Enforced strict **MFA and Conditional Access policies** across clinical and finance user groups.
    *   Acted as the primary bridge between client stakeholders and backend engineering for complex identity escalations.
*   **Outcome**: Drastically reduced standing privileges and unauthorized access attempts. Maintained a **resolution rate of ~85 tickets/day** (21k/year) without sacrificing verification rigor.
*   **Tools**: Entra ID (Azure AD), PIM, PowerShell, ServiceNow.
